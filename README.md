# TranslateApp

## Personal Objectives
This project aimed to understand and apply how Angular's componentization works and its main features. I used Sass for styling and Bootstrap 5 and its components to facilitate some project functionalities

## How it works

It is a game where the objective is to translate sentences from English to Portuguese. The player starts with 4 lives, and each mistake costs a life. If you run out of lives, the game ends and you lose. If you correctly translate all the sentences, the game is completed, and you win!
